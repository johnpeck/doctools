% Configure section numbers
%
% The code word that prints the current value of the counter in your 
% document is \thecounter. That is, \thepart, \thechapter, \thesection 
% and so on.
%----------------------------------------------------------------------

% Redefine the section numbers to reference the part number.  
% For example, the first section in the first part will look like
% I.1 instead of just 1.
\renewcommand{\thesection}{\thepart.\arabic{section}}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------
% Configure the table of contents
%
% See the tocloft package documentation for descriptions of the \cft
% commands (contents, figures, tables)
%----------------------------------------------------------------------

% These next commands control the size of the box in which the title
% number is formatted.  The title number will be flushleft inside of
% the box.  Note that this box does not grow as the title number grows.
% So big title numbers like 1.2.1234 will need bigger boxes, and you'll
% need to set these by hand.  This is actually a feature -- when you
% look at the toc, all subsubsection titles will be indented the same
% amount, regardless of the width of the title number.

% \cftsecnumwidth -- the width from the beginning of the title number
% to the title when the number terminates in a section number
\setlength{\cftsecnumwidth}{1cm}

% \cftsubsecnumwidth -- the width from the beginning of the title number
% to the title when the number terminates in a subsection number
\setlength{\cftsubsecnumwidth}{1.5cm}

% \cftsubsubsecnumwidth -- the width from the beginning of the title 
% number to the title when the number terminates in a subsubsection number
\setlength{\cftsubsubsecnumwidth}{2cm}
