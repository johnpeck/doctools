To make icons from the /usr/share/icons/Tango/scalable directories, use
the export function of inkscape:
inkscape -z -E=output.eps iconfile.svg

Browse the icons using the 32x32 directory of the default Tango icons.
These are just pngs, so the ristretto program is a nice browser for them:
ristretto /usr/share/icons/Rodent/48x48/status &
...will let you browse the status directory.
